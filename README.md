# Huntdown

Often when I am in precarious situations I am also sans wifi. Also often when I am in precarious situations, I need to write some code.

If you've ever tried to run `npm install` in precarious situations like me, then Huntdown is exactly what you need.

Huntdown will literally hunt down the modules you're looking for in your local machine, recursively!
